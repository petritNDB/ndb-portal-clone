          NDB is one of the earliest adopters and developers of nuclear voltaic
          cells for mid and high power applications. The self charging battery
          produces stable power by converting the energy released from nuclear
          decay into usable energy all throughout its lifetime which is
          generally many years.

          Nuclear batteries have been around for sometime but the batteries are
          limited to low power applications due to their efficiency. NDB
          optimises this technology for high power applications. We propose to
          reuse nuclear fuel by recycling it to extract radioisotopes. Isotopes
          from the recycled nuclear waste or from an accelerator release a high
          level of energy particles that can be transformed into usable energy.
