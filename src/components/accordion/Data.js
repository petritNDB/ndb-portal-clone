      "Modern life is heavily reliant on mobile battery-powered devices affecting daily aspects of our lives, ranging from telecommunication devices to transport vehicles and beyond earth in aerospace technology. There is an increasing demand for efficient and cost-effective batteries from manufacturers, meaning a constant need for improvement on the current state of affairs. Conventional batteries have been riddled with numerous concerns, and in the age of increasing consciousness about global warming and waste accumulation, production must be in line with sustainable development principles and the process of qualitative change,Additionally,this innovation can solve the global problem of nuclear waste. Nuclear power is extremely useful but it has its shortcomings in the nuclear waste it produces. This is a costly problem that is costing over US$ 100 billion globally. Our innovation is made from recycled nuclear waste and therefore will address this issue, making nuclear power a greener option than before.",

      "The UN Secretary-General António Guterres has declared the problem as an emergency, “(...) it’s a race that we are losing but we could win”. The UN has set a goal of becoming net-zero emission by 2050 to mitigate this. The current projection of CO2 emission for 2050 is 43.08 billion metric tonnes, which is far from neutrality. One major shift to achieve the objective is to use electricity generated from renewable sources. However, the bottleneck is the energy storage device that is used by consumers. Current technology Li-ion batteries have the problem of low battery life and toxic material, delaying the adoption amongst consumers especially in the automotive industry.",

      "NDB is a new type of battery that defies the nature of what a battery is meant to be. It is a battery that does not run out in a single user’s lifetime because it harnesses the power of energetic electron emission from radioisotopes and has a tremendously long half-life. The end product upon fruition will be able to constantly provide energy to almost any items that are powered by a battery.",

      "Why is nobody else doing it? What is the current workaround, and how well does it address the problem you are solving?",
    content:
      "The solution, NDB, requires in-depth knowledge of its base material, diamond, to develop in comparison to the current workaround, Li-ion. The field is very small, thus there were fewer individuals working to develop it before. In addition, this technology was made possible due to the improvement of the nano-fabrication techniques such as Chemical Vapour Deposition (CVD) and metallization, which were previously unavailable. The current workaround, Li-ion, has somewhat addressed the problem, but not to the degree required for satisfying the goal set by the international community. The base material for Li-ion is toxic and has many limitations that consumers are not currently facing.",
