The self charging battery produces stable power by converting the energy released from nuclear decay into usable energy all throughout its lifetime which is generally many years.",
    parag2:
      "Nuclear batteries have been around for sometime but the batteries are limited to low power applications due to their efficiency. NDB optimises this technology for high power applications. We propose to reuse nuclear fuel by recycling it to extract radioisotopes. Isotopes from the recycled nuclear waste or from an accelerator release a high level of energy particles that can be transformed into usable energy.",
